# FIZZ BUZZ

A program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1 to 100, with three exceptions. For numbers divisible by 3 (and not 5), prints "Fizz" instead of the number, and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), prints "Buzz" instead. Prints "FizzBuzz" for numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5.
